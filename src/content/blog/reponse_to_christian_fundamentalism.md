# Introduction
This is my first post here on my new website! Thought I would skip the formalities and start with a deep topic. I am a baby-christian, truly converting within the past 2 years. I believe that the Bible is the ultimate source of Christian authority, but there is one giant hurdle between us and the word of God: interpretation. This post will try and dissect, using Biblical guidance, what is important about Biblical interpretation and what isn't. I will not point to one correct interpretation of the Bible, as I don't believe there is one. Instead I will explore about what the Bible has to say about belief itself.


To start, I will not say that there is not one true version of Christanity. I am personaly more aligned with the Catholic and Orthodox traditions, but I don't think there is anyone but Jesus who could tell us where we stand.

# Some Core Principals
Here are some basic principals that I will base my arguements off of.

1. God's reflection is manifest in the world (Holy Spirit).
2. Everything that is beautiful, good, and just comes directly from God.
3. If you believe something in the Bible is not true, its probably not the bible, it's you.
4. The core of what being a Christian is is not belief but a state of being and actions.*


* This is not saying that works are what leads to salvation, but more of a recognition that if you have faith and belief, you should feel strongly towards acting in ways that glorify God.

# Falling into the trap of Gnosticism
Its easy to over-fixate on the historical and revelatory aspect of Christanity and not see the everyday reality of it. 



“See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.”   Colossians 2.8
 
As Bible-believing Christians we must avoid preachers and teachers who promote man-made ideas. Consider Paul’s examples;
 
1.Philosophy. This word means “the love of wisdom.”
The problem with philosophy is that it is man-made.
When preachers talk about politics and social action, we are drifting from our mandate to “Preach the Word.” We should be able to support everything we say with chapter, book and verse. Man’s opinion does not matter.

2.Deception. Fund raising tactics are often deceptive. I hear Christian radio programs offering “free” books that you can receive if you a contribution. Even evangelistic efforts can be deceptive. One ministry advertised a “youth ranch.”
There were no cowboys or ponies; it was actually a meeting where young people heard a sermon.

3.Tradition. We do many things in our churches that are not commanded by scripture or mentioned in the book of Acts. We should ask; “Why are we doing this? The answer may be “We’ve always done it that way.”

4.Worldly principles. A pastor told me that he wanted his church to be more like a night club than a church. This idea has caught on in America. Many churches have become entertainment venues with more music and less teaching. How can you see your Bible while sitting in a dark room? Theatrical Christianity is not biblical Christianity.

5. Christian “celebrities.”  Christ must have the pre-eminence. In many places the church has become the cult of the personality. Pastors are glorified and addressed with lofty titles like “Father, Reverend, Bishop or Doctor.”  How did the Christians address great leaders in the early church? Peter, Paul, James, John, etc. We don’t even know their last names.
