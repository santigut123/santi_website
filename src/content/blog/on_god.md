# Introduction

I am a Christian, but for a long time I was deeply Atheistic. The reason that I became a Christian initially was because of the value I thought it brought to the world. Call it a pragmatist approach. It was a simple faith, Christianity is a beautiful and cohesive story that manages to invigorate our psychology and create a society where the good seems to prevail often-- therefore I believe it. 

But I don't think that is where our understanding of God should end. Later on in my Christian journey I started learning about Metaphyics and Theology. Through this learning, I have come to believe that God is neccessary for the existence of the world, and neccessary as a justification for our participation in things like reason,love, math, science, etc. 

So the point of this post is to try and go through some Atheist/Scientism based points and see where I can poke holes in them, and also just share what I think is important.

I want to say that Christianity is not just a set of beliefs in supernatural events/entities. It is a living and breathing faith, that requires participation. If you are interested in the experiential and participatory parts of Christianity, I highly recommend going to a traditional Catholic or Orthodox service near you. There is a magical and wonderful wordlessness in those experiences, and you wont be getting that with Philosophy or words.

If you are interested in words, or want something with less of a barrier, read Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. It is a defining piece of our culture and it is the most divinely devastating set of words ever put together by a man.


# Truth and Belief

Here's something funny, most of us don't care about truth. In fact most truths are actually trivial. I can rattle of an infinite amount of true statements that wouldn't matter to you. What humans truly care about is things that have value. That is the first consideration, then truth enters the equation. What does this have to do with God? Well firstly we don't need scientific proof that God exists to believe in him. Just like you wouldn't need scientific proof that someone loves you in order to believe that they love you. And secondly what the core of what makes a fact anything useful to a human is in the value system that created it.

So how do we create this value system? We have values such as honesty, transparency, trust, inherent human value. Can we prove these values are good using science? Turns out we can't.
