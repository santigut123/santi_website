# Introduction
Cooking is hard, *until its not*. Part of the reason behind cooking's enigmatic status is that a lot of it is an Art. It contains many variables like Temperature, Cookware, Spices, Texture, Time and probably way too many other things.

However, if you aren't worried about cooking at the level of a professional chef, there are some tips that can help you get to a point that you can cook healthy and tasty meals for yourself in no time. 

# Guiding Principals

## Macros
As all great and deeply meaningful things, macros come in a trinity. Its component parts are fat, carbs,and protein. I will talk about how they fit into the puzzle of a weekday meal.

## Protein
Protein is a non negotiable macro in every meal. Snacks are allowed to not have protein but there should never be a meal without protein. Protein is the most satiating out of the 3 macros. 
## Carbs
Carbs are primarily seen through the lens of energy. They are cheap, calorically dense, and you can eat a lot without being satiated. If you are working out a lot and need energy it is good to eat a decent amount of carbs. The best form of carbs is fruit, as most fruit have useful nutrients. However it is easy to overeat on carbs, especially refined ones like white rice and bread. If you are looking to remove extra calories, replace refined carbs with fruit. My guidance is to not replace it with whole grains, which although are more satieting, they come with bad stuff like anti-nutrients etc. If you are looking to cut weight you can even avoid all refined carbs all together or maybe have a meal or two where you skip eating them.
## Fat
Fat is complex macro. On one hand, fats are more satiating than carbs, but on the other hand, they can have some really negative effects if you are eating the wrong kind. The best form of fats are Saturated fats and cholesterol, they are what our body turns our excess caloric load into and they make up most of our cells. The worst form are PUFAs (Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids). They are an inherently unstable form of fat that is best enjoyed in small quantities. The other thing about fats, is that they are the most calorically dense at 9 grams, with protein and carbs being 4. Reducing fat can be a good thing if you are trying to lose weight, but going too low on saturated fat will do bad things to your body.
